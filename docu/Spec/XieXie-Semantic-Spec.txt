program:
	(Phase 1)
	Register all unique class identifiers in global scope.
	
	(Phase 2)
	Analyze signature of all classes (decorate attributes and type inheritance).
	
	(Phase 3)
	Verify that the inheritance tree of all classes are free of cycles.
	
	(Phase 4)
	In all classes: Register all class member identifiers (procedures, variables, enumerations, flags)
	in the scope of the current class. Identifiers of procedures can be overloaded.
	
	(Phase 5)
	In all classes: In all members of the current class: Analyze the declaration of the current member.

var_decl_stmnt:
	(Phase 4)
	Register symbol for class member variables.
	
	(Phase 5)
	For class member variables: Verify that initializer expression is a constant expression.
	For local variables: Register symbol for local variables.
	For all variables: Decorate declaration type, decorate initializer expression,
	and verify that type of expression is compatible to the declaration type.
